<h1>Travis's Favorite Movies List</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>If you're a huge fan of science this is the movie for you.
A thriller combined with an emotional drama, this movie hits it
completely out of the park.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park - The Lost World</h3>
<p>Jurassic Park - The Lost World is a classic that the entire
    famaily can watch. At times Jeff golbloom mixes funny and seriousness,
it's a blast that can be pretty intense. </p>
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>If you're into super hero action, this movie is amoung the best.
    billionaire-philanthropist Tony Stark sets off on a journey to stop 
    the immoral sale of his weapons to terrorists. A truly execellent film.
